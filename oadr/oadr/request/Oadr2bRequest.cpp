// FLOSSE (released under the FLOSS exception w/a proprietary license)
// #########################################################################################
//
// This software relies on the Code Synthesis XSD generated code and the XSD runtime, 
// hereforto referred to as libxsd.  The generated code can be found under the oadrsd directory.
// The XSD headers and runtime can be found under the xsd directory. libxsd is released under
// the GPLv2 but is used and included in the source tree in compliance with a proprietary
// license, purchased from Code Synthesis, the copyright holder of libxsd.  This license
// allows EPRI to release liboadr under the BSD-3 Clause license and non-virally include
// libxsd
//
// YOU MAY USE liboadr UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BSD-3 CLAUSE LICENSE, BUT YOU MAY NOT SEPARATE
// THE libxsd COMPONENTS AND USE libxsd IN YOUR OWN PROJECT USING THE BSD-3 CLAUSE LICENSE.

// 
// 1. Intent
// 
// We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") to be
// able to use the specified GPL-licensed XSD runtime library (libxsd) and
// XSD generated code (collectively called the "Program") despite the fact
// that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU
// General Public License (the "GPL").
// 
// It is our intent to allow distribution of the entire Derivative Work
// (including the Program) under one or more of the FLOSS licenses listed
// in section 3 (section 2.a). It is also our intent to disallow simple
// relicensing of the Program for the sole purpose of using it in
// proprietary applications (section 2.b and 2.c). As an example, consider
// two hypothetical scenarios:
// 
//  a) You created a program that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD
//     runtime library to access information in XML instance documents.
//     Your program performs useful computations based on this information
//     (sections 2.b and 2.c are satisfied). You distribute your program,
//     including the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime library under
//     the BSD license and make it available at no charge to all third
//     parties (section 2.a is satisfied). Later you (or someone else) may
//     choose to base their proprietary application on your code since the
//     BSD license does not prohibit it.
// 
//     This scenario falls under this FLOSS Exception.
// 
// 
//  b) You created a library that uses the XSD generated code and the XSD
//     runtime library to access information in XML instance documents. You
//     did not add to the library any other useful code that uses the XSD
//     generated code or the XSD runtime library (neither section 2.b nor
//     2.c is satisfied). You distribute your library, including the XSD
//     generated code and the XSD runtime library under the BSD license and
//     make it available at no charge to all third parties (section 2.a
//     is satisfied). Later you base your proprietary application on this
//     library since the BSD license does not prohibit it.
// 
//     This scenario does not fall under this FLOSS Exception (neither
//     section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You created the library for the
//     sole purpose of making the XSD generated code and the XSD runtime
//     library available to your proprietary application.
// 
// 
// 2. Legal Terms and Conditions
// 
// As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2 of
// the GPL you are free to distribute a verbatim copy of the Program
// as part of the Derivative Work that is formed from the Program or
// any part thereof and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") as
// long as you also meet all of these conditions:
// 
//   a) You must cause the Derivative Work that in whole or in part
//      contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
//      to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
//      under the terms of one or more of the licenses listed in
//      section 3.
// 
//   b) The Derivative Work should contain one or more FLOSS Work that
//      can be reasonably considered as derived from the Program or some
//      part thereof.
// 
//   c) The Derivative Work should not contain any part of the Program
//      that cannot be reasonably considered as a base of one or more
//      FLOSS Work.
// 
// 
// 3. FLOSS License List
// 
//   a) Any license listed in the "GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses"
//      and the "GPL-Incompatible Free Software Licenses" sections of the
//      License List as published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF):
// 
//      http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
// 
// 
// 4. Definitions
// 
// Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in
// the GPL.
// 
// Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.
// 
// 
// 5. Applicability
// 
// You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
// the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that
// copy of the Program.
